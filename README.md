This repository contains the major versions of the helical antenna scaffold OpenSCAD files. These can be used to generate a completely customized scaffold for a helical antenna of any application (HRPT dish feed, Inmarsat antenna, Wifi, FPV, ...).

Short summary of each version included:

**Version 5 - LATEST**  
![](https://github.com/sgcderek/dsgc-helix-scaffold/blob/funny/dsgc_helix_v5.png?raw=true)  
Created with Thingiverse online customizer in mind; a lot of (imo useless) features from v4 were dropped in favor of cleaner code and much faster rendering time. Parameters easier to understand and more straight-forward to use, the code should also be more readable and easier to edit. **It is recommended to use this version unless you require a specific feature from an older one.**

**Version 4**

An improvement over v3 mainly meant to tackle a common issue with the support legs breaking. Uses up slightly more plastic and printing time in favor of a much more sturdy construction. Also comes with more customization parameters.

**Version 3**

Initial recreation of the former scaffolds made manually and individually in Fusion 360. Probably don't use this anymore.

*Versions 1 and 2 were one-offs made in Fusion 360 on an individual basis*
