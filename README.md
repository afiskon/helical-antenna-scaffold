# Helical Antenna Scaffold and Calculator

This is a fork of 3D printable helical antenna scaffold implemented
by [@sgcderek][1] in 2021-2023.

The difference from the original is that this project has a built-in antenna
calculator. The calculation method is based on the [book by Igor, DL2KQ][2].
You only specify the desired frequency and optionally other parameters.
The math is done by OpenSCAD.
